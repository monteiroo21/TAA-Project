    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation, training, and evaluation of an Autoencoder model for the task of translating Infrared (IR) satellite imagery to Passive Microwave Rainfall (PMR) estimations. The core idea is to learn a compressed representation of the input IR image and then reconstruct the corresponding PMR image.\n",
