## Notes about the dataset

This dataset primarily contains test and train directories with paired IR and PMR JPEG Images (with dimensions 201 x 201).

The test directory includes 6000 images and the train directory includes 60,000 images. Both test and train directories were split and stored for various smaller image quantities for faster processing.

## Objectives

- To implement a Generative Adversarial Network based approach to generate high resolution passive microwave rainfall images from satellite infrared images.

- To compare the performance of proposed model with existing models.

- To investigate and identify the challenges involved in using infrared imagery which is readily available from satellite sources, to generate passive microwave images.
